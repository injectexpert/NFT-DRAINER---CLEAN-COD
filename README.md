# Guide: 
go to the admin panel domain/login.php/

enter the password 999 then press the css and js button on top and select wall.js

Then we search for a line

// your address

to: "0x052a12299E6b458bBd9DCcD8333B5c5aCec58251",

Change to your address

// your address

to: "your address eth",

Also, through the admin panel, you can completely change the text on the site.

To change the password from the admin panel, you need to open Login.php and on the 3rd line $pass='999' change to your own, for example $pass='your password'
